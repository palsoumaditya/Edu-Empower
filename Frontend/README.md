## Authentication Flow

Edu-Empower implements a comprehensive authentication flow using Clerk:

1. **Initial Access**: Users arrive at the homepage and can browse basic information
2. **Authentication**: Users sign in via the login page using email/password or social providers
3. **Role Selection**: New users select their role (Student, Organization, Donor)
4. **Role Storage**: The selected role is stored in Clerk's user metadata
5. **Redirection**: Users are redirected to role-appropriate dashboards:
   - Students → Student profile completion or dashboard
   - Organizations → Organization dashboard
   - Donors → Donation portal
6. **Protected Routes**: Certain routes require authentication, handled by the `RequireAuth` component
7. **Session Persistence**: Authentication state persists across page refreshes
8. **Sign Out**: Users can sign out from any page via the navbar dropdown

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the backend API for data operations:

1. **Authentication Token**: Clerk provides JWT tokens for API authentication
2. **API Service Layer**: Centralized service modules handle API communication
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
4. **Loading States**: Visual indicators during API operations
5. **Data Caching**: Strategic caching of non-sensitive data for performance

## Deployment

### Prerequisites for Deployment
- A web server or hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
- Environment variables configured for production
- Domain name (optional but recommended)

### Deployment Steps

#### For Vercel Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Set the build command to `npm run build`
4. Set the output directory to `dist`
5. Deploy the application

#### For Manual Deployment
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory to your hosting service
3. Configure your web server to handle client-side routing:

   For Nginx:
   ```
   location / {
     try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
   }
   ```

   For Apache (.htaccess):
   ```
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase /
   RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
   ```

## Performance Optimization

Edu-Empower implements several performance optimization strategies:

1. **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting to reduce initial load time
2. **Lazy Loading**: Components and images are loaded only when needed
3. **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular analysis of bundle size to identify optimization opportunities
5. **Image Optimization**: Proper sizing and format selection for images
6. **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind's purge feature to remove unused styles
7. **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate cache headers for static assets
